# SMIT Batch 8 Mini-Hackathon-2022

## Attendance Application

**Note:** This project has been assigned to you as your Mini Hackathon task.

**SMIT Attendance Application:** You have to complete the given task within the time limit of 12
hours.

**Technologies:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Firebase, Bootstrap (or any other library)

**Brief Summary:** Students are required to create an attendance portal system for SMIT students. Saylani assigned admin can mark attendance and review it whenever needed.

### An admin can do following detailed described tasks

**What Admin can do?**

- Sign in (As an admin)
- Admin can add class details with following details (CRUD):
  - Class timings
  - Schedule of classes
  - Teacher’s name
  - Section name.
  - Course Name
  - Batch Number
- Admin can add the following details of students(CRUD):
  - Name
  - Father Name
  - Roll Number
  - Contact Number
  - CNIC number
  - Picture.
  - Course Name
  - Admin will assign a class to every student.
- Now Admin would select the particular course’s class for attendance. When Admin selects the class, an ID card UI with placeholders will pop-up with an input bar for roll numbers & when students start entering roll numbers, their data will be shown with their complete details on the card in real time.
- This input bar will also have a drop down with 4 options. Present, Absent, Late or Leave. Default **Present** will be available.

- If any student enters a roll number to mark attendance after 10 minutes of their class start time, it will be marked as **late** automatically, if he tries to change late status from drop down, it will require an admin password.

- If someone marks attendance as **leave** or **absent**, he has to enter an admin password to verify his leave is approved.
- Any student, whose attendance is not marked, will be marked as absent automatically.
- Students' statistics can be reviewed there (previous data of attendance).
- Admin can transfer a student from 1 section to another. You should maintain a history of the student sections. So when the admin will review attendance data or student details, he can see his section history as well.
